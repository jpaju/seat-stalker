## Development enviornment
The application could be run locally either using SBT or Azure Functions Core Tools. Both approaches require Telegram configuration in order to send notifications.

### SBT
1. Create `.env` file to the root folder of the project and add the following configuration in it
	```
	telegram_chatId=<chat-id>
	telegram_token=<token>
	```
2. Start SBT and run `run` command

### Azure Functions
1. [Install Azure Functions Core Tools (v4)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-functions/functions-run-local?tabs=v4%2Cmacos%2Ccsharp%2Cportal%2Cbash#v2)
2. Start local blob storage emulator by running `docker-compose up`
3. Package the project into a jar file by running `sbt assembly`
4. Navigate to `azure-functions` folder
5. Create configuration file `local.settings.json` and add the following configuration:
	```json
	{
		"IsEncrypted": false,
		"Values": {
			"AzureWebJobsStorage": "DefaultEndpointsProtocol=http;AccountName=devstoreaccount1;AccountKey=Eby8vdM02xNOcqFlqUwJPLlmEtlCDXJ1OUzFT50uSRZ6IFsuFq2UVErCz4I6tq/K1SZFPTOtr/KBHBeksoGMGw==;BlobEndpoint=http://127.0.0.1:10000/devstoreaccount1;",
			"FUNCTIONS_WORKER_RUNTIME": "java",
			"telegram_chatId": "<chat-id>",
			"telegram_token": "<token>"
		}
	}
	```

6. Run `func start`
